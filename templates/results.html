            <h1>ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION</h1>
            <div class="info">
                <h2>a. Which search algorithm performed the best overall?</h2>
                <p>
                    As evident in Table 1 and the fourth figure shown above, the interpolation
                    search algorithm performed the best overall. Across all the trials in the
                    given target sets 100, 1000, and 10000, this type of search algorithm garnered
                    the least average execution time. Therefore, this result only serves as evidence
                    that among all the different algorithms, the interpolation search algorithm is the
                    fastest.
                </p>
                <h2>b. Did any search algorithms perform better on specific data sets?</h2>
                <p>
                    As shown in table 1, the average execution time of Interpolation is 0.0067ms making
                    it the fastest search algorithm. Interpolation search works well on uniformly distributed
                    and sorted data. It's particularly efficient when the data set has a linear distribution.
                    Binary search is effective on sorted data sets. In cases where the data is not uniformly
                    distributed, or there are repeated elements, it might perform better than interpolation search.
                    Ternary search is useful when the data is sorted but not as effective as binary search in many
                    cases. It divides the search space into three parts instead of two. Exponential search is
                    efficient when there is a known upper bound on the size of the data set. It works particularly
                    well when the target element is likely to be close to the beginning of the array. Jump search
                    is effective for large, uniformly distributed data sets. It combines aspects of linear search
                    and binary search, making it suitable for cases where binary search might be impractical.
                    Linear search is generally less efficient than binary search on large, sorted datasets
                    because it has only a linear time complexity. In all the given data sets (100,1000,10000),
                    there is no better search algorithm to use than Interpolation.
                </p>
                <h2>c. How did the size of the data set affect the performance of the search algorithms?</h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the laboratory exercise, our close collaboration focused on analyzing and optimizing
                    search algorithms, revealing a clear correlation between the size of the data and algorithm
                    performance. As the size of the data set increased, so did the time complexity of the various
                    search algorithms. This pattern demonstrated that larger data sets generally created difficulties
                    for search operations, necessitating a review of algorithm choices and observation into
                    optimization strategies to preserve efficiency when dealing with significant volumes of data.
                </p>
                <h2>d. Write a brief conclusion summarizing your findings.</h2>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, the average execution time of Interpolation is 0.0067ms making it the fastest
                    search algorithm, while Binary has an average of 0.0069ms, Ternary has 0.0105ms, Exponential
                    has 0.0135ms, Jump has 0.0143ms, and lastly is the Linear which has 0.2397ms that implies the
                    slowest among all search algorithm. Moreover, the study highlighted the impact of data set size
                    on algorithm performance. As the size of the data set increased, the time complexity of the
                    search algorithms also escalated. This observation underscores the need for careful consideration
                    and optimization of algorithm choices, especially when dealing with larger volumes of data.
                    The efficiency of the interpolation search algorithm positions it as a favorable choice for
                    scenarios where speed is crucial, while the study provides valuable insights into the nuanced
                    relationship between algorithm performance and data set size.
